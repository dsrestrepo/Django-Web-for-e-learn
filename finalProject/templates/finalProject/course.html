            <h4>What is?</h4>
            The Statistical Inference is a way of analyzing properties of a population based on a sample
            <br>
            for example we can know the distribution of probabilities to know if a hypotesis is true, or see the
            behavior of a population based just on a sample of a data
            <h4>We can see applications in:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigation in general: </li> Used to find the confidence results of a investigation
                <li>Data Science: </li> Used to abstract the behavior of all a entire population data form a sample
                <li>Life sciences: </li> Used to make test for example of a vaccine or to understand the distribution of
                some
                characteristics like genome in a population from a sample.
            </ul>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            We are working with a laboratory to find out what effect can have a new product on the weight of the people
            of this city
            We have the hypotesis that this new product decrease people's weight, but we can't do a test for all the
            city
            But we can use the statistical inference, taking a sample of all the city and with that sample prove our
            hypothesis.
            <h6>Null Hypothesis: </h6> This means that the mean doesn't have any change respect to how it soposed to be
            <div>
                \[H_{0}\]
            </div>
            <h6>Alternate hypothesis: </h6> That means that our mean has change (less or more) respect to what it was
            supposed to be without the product, for our example this means that the product will change the mean weight
            less or more
            <div>
                \[H_{1} \neq H_{0}\]
            </div>

            <h4>Sample Data:</h4>So we will take two samples to see if the products works
            <ul>
                <li>sample using the product</li>
                <li>sample without using the product</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How do we know it works?</h4>
            <h6>Central Limit Theorem</h6> This says that the mean of a sample if the sample is significant will have a
            normal distribution with mean at the original and a similar
            standard deviation, specifically the original standard deviation over the square root of the sample size
            <h6>Example: </h6>
            <h6>If our population is: </h6> \[P(x) = \frac{1}{ {\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } } }e^{ { { - \left( {x - \mu }
            \right)^2 } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom { { - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 } } } \right.}
            {2\sigma ^2 } } }\]
            with mean: \[\mu\] and standard deviation: \[\sigma \neq 0\]
            <h6>our sample will be: </h6> mean \[\bar{x_{n}} = \mu \] and standard deviation \[\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]
            with n the size of the sample
            Then if we take a random sample z: \[z = \frac{\bar{x_{n}}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\]

        <a class="btn btn-outline-success item" data-id="section2">Probability</a>
        <div class="alert alert-dark course_content_div" id="section2">

            <h1>Probability</h1>

            <h4>What is?</h4>
            The Probability is a science that try to predict an event givig a posbility from 0 to 1 or from 0% to 100%
            being 0 no possibility og that event and 1 or 100% an event that ve happend or will happend for sure
            <h4>We can see applications in almost all the fields of the science for example:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science: </li> Is a commun way to predict results, there are many probabilistic algotihms such
                as Naive Bayes that help us organize our data, or predict.
                <li>Life sciences: </li> So used in medicine to understand people behavior, in epidemiology for example
                to see the distribution
                in the transmission rate of a new virus, or to undertsand new diagnostics and the probability of error
                <li>Social Science</li> Used to see how people will spend and predict market variations
                <li>physics</li> Used in particle physics to help understand the position, or for example used by
                Boltzman to understand
                the behavior and distribution of particules in some spac
                <li>Many more...</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>To understand the Probability we need to know some definitions:</h4>
            <h6>sample space</h6> This tell us al the possible results, we use an S={...} to write this, for example
            if we if we toss a dice, of sample space will be:
            \[S_{d} = \left\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \right\}\]
            <h6>simple event</h6> This is a sub-group of the sample space given by some rules, for example if we are
            playing
            parchis and we need a numer from 5 onwards then our simple event will be:
            \[A_{d} = \left\{ 5,6 \right\}\]
            <h6>The probability</h6> Are the chances of an event happening, for example for the last sample space if
            we have the same probability for all the dice faces we can use the
            <strong>Laplace's rule</strong> Say that the probability of an event is the possible cases over the total
            then our probability of A will be:
            \[P(A)=\frac{ \sum_{ i=0 }^A Ai }{ \sum_{ i=0 }^S Si }\]
            \[P(A_{d}) = \frac{ 2 }{ 6 }\]

            <h6>compound event</h6> We could have events compose from two or more simple events example: with simple
            event A and B:
            <ul>
                <li>Event A or Event B \[A \cup B\]</li>
                <li>Event A and Event B \[A \cap B\]</li>
                <li>Event A given Event B \[A \mid B\]</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>probability distributions</h6> Tell us the probability of events given a sample space this could be:
            <ul>
                <li>Continuous like 1,2,3,4,5,6 (like an histogram)</li>
                <li>Discreet like 0-1 being 0 the the area under the curve</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>probability distribution in R:</h6>
            <pre style="height: 200px;"><code class="language-r">
#if we have our data in a var X
#Empirical Cummulative Density Function (ECDF)
myCDF = ecdf(x)
#we can see if we plot:
plot(ecdf(x))
#we can calculate the probability between some events like:
mean(x <= a)
                    </code></pre>
            <h6>binomial distribution</h6> If we want to know the possibility of some events given some attempts:
            \[f(x)=\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\ x\end{array}\right) p^{x} q^{n-x}\]
            \[\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\ x\end{array}\right) = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}\]
            with:
            <ul>
                <li>p=Probability of our event</li>
                <li>q=probability of failure (1-p)</li>
                <li>n=attempts</li>
                <li>x=numer of success events in n</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bayes Theorem:</h4> The Bayes Theorem is too a big part of the probability and is the most crazy one
            We start from a we start from a priori knowledge to know if an event will happend, for example if you are
            playing
            with a dice and the dice keep being a 6 in many examples, the frequentist probability tell us that those
            events were
            independet, and the next one will be independet, but bayes uses that extra information to estimate the next
            move.

            \[P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

            <h6>Example: </h6> With the Bayes theorem the examples are the most exciting part, for example, If you go
            for a medical examination for a strange disease
            and they tell you that the test came out positive with a 99% chance of error, you may think that you are
            almost certainly sick
            but using the bayes theorem if you know that the disease is so stange most than the error chance of the test
            you may think that:
            <div class="equation">
                \[P(Disease\mid Positive) = \frac{P(Positive \mid Disease) \cdot P(Disease)}{P(Positive)}\]
            </div>
            where:
            <div class="equation">
                \[P(Positive) = P(Positive \mid Disease) + P(Positive \mid NotDisease)\]
            </div>
            if we know that the Probability of disease is so slow the probability is considerably lower
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-dark course_content_div" id="section3">

            <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
            <h4>What is?</h4>
            The linear algebra is the a science that studies linear ecuations, linear models, vector and matrix
            operations
            so we can use it to abstract models that hel´pu us to understand the world, take data sturctures, solve
            multiple ecuations of a fastest way
            <h4>We can see applications in almost all the fields of the science too:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science: </li>
                if you enroll in the course of data science and computer science you'll see many data srcutres, models
                and ways to use this to predict, and undertstand the world
                <li>Life sciences: </li>
                We can combine the statistical inference with linear algebra to understand the variables of a entire
                populations
                see patrons in the behavior of that population and find constants
                <li>Social Science: </li>
                With the linear algebra we can see predictions of how markets works, how peple buys, etc.
                <li>physics: </li>
                We can use the linear algebra to solve ecuations, know constants analyze experimental results,etc.
                <li>Many more...</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>To understand the Linear Algebra we need to know some definitions:</h4>
            <h6>Vector: </h6> A vector is a array of real numbers, this can be use in informatics as a way to organize
            seies of numbers, in a 1xn
            matrix, but you can see regular aplications of a vector in math and phisics as a way to represent a magnitud
            and a phase in a
            mutidimensional space, for exmple in the Reals we can represent a number as a vector of 1x1 dimension, but
            also you can represent it in
            two dimensions usually in math represented as a i in the axis y, and we can increase those values till
            infinite:
            \[2 Dimensions: (x,y) = x + y\widehat{i} \]
            \[3 Dimensions: (x,y,z) = x + y\widehat{i} + z\widehat{j} \]
            \[n Dimensions: (x,y,...,n) = x + y\widehat{i} + ... + n \widehat{n} \]

            <h6>Matrix: </h6> A matrix is an array of many Vectors represented by mxm dimensions, we can see a vector as
            a 1xm dimension's array, this is
            an important way to organize sets of data and wee neet to know they operations to for example, solve many
            ecuations, do operations between, etc.
            so we have:
            \[\begin{bmatrix}a & a1 & a2 & ... & an \\ b & b1 & b2 & ... & bn \\ ... \\ m & m1 & m2 & ... &

            <h4>There are many class of regressions:</h4>
            <h6>Linear Regressions: </h6>
            The linear regression is a type of regression formed by the equation of a line of the form:
            \[Y = aX + b + \epsilon\]
            If you have multiple ecuations you can solve them using methods as we saw in linear algebra:
            \[Y = aX\] if X and Y are matix you can fin a as:
            \[a = Y^{-1} X\]
            you can see an example of a linear regression here:

            <h4>What is?</h4>
            The computer science is a science that teach us to understand the information's theory, what is a computer machine, how it works,
            how to think with logic and create algotihms to solve problems 
            <h4>To understand the computer science we first need to know the history:</h4>
            The humans have always tried to create machines in a way that can help us with repetitive and tedious tasks, as proof of this we see machines
            to perform tasks such as transporting or carrying things have always been there, but these machines have always had some problems for example
            are machines that jusk work well for one task, these were great impediments until the creation of:
            <h4>processor: </h4> 
            <h6>The 12 of november of 1936 <strong>Alan Turing</strong> published the article <i><a href="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230">"ON COMPUTABLE NUMBERS, WITH AN APPLICATION TO
            THE ENTSCHEIDUNGSPROBLEM"</a></i></h6>. In this article Turing introduce us to the Turing Machine, a Machine with which we can do an infinite number of mathematical operations
            like add, subtract, multiply, etc. But the most amazing part is that this architecture is the same architecture used by computers today with the
            Turing Machine: The turing machine is a machine compose by a tape a with some grid each grid represent a symbol (actualy a data) this symbols are values and 
            operations that the machine will do, for example we can move symbols right or left, change the value, see past symbols, all depending of the length of the tape, so if we have 
            an infinite tape we can do infinite operations, this (simple) sistem is actualy used in computers to move data in memory, do complicated operations, etc.

            <h4>Programming: </h4> 
            <h6>In 1950 <strong>Kathleen Booth</strong> Did the first assembly language </h6>. 
            Before 1950 the computer were made changing the sturcture of the computers, but this assembly language was the first "programming language" that help us to 
            change the instructions in the computer without the need to modify its physical structure, but by giving instructions.
            <h6>The August 10 of 1937 <strong>Claude Shannon</strong> Published <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/11173/34541425-MIT.pdf">"A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits"</a></h6>. 
            In this article Shannon analyzed the characteristics of switching circuits and how using boolean algebra we could do any operation that we wanted
            just with 1's and 0's, and this is how actaully the computers do the operations, but we don´t programm using binary, we actually use a specific syntax, well
            the true is that we have, the
            <h6>Programming language and interpreters </h6>
            thess work as a bridge between a more human readable language (Programming language) and the computer (binary) the interpreters does that traslate task.

            <h1>Programming Basics theory</h1>
            
            <h4>Progmramming language</h4>
            The programming language is the language that we use to talk with the computer and give instructions, there are many programming languages with many aplications
            <h4>We can see aplications in: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science: </li> There are many programming languages created to analyze data, datastructures, graph, statistics,and more...
                Some examples are Python, R
                <li>Web programming: </li> This is a common topic in programming, we can see many programming languages that run in the server as php or javascript, or we can see many 
                languages that run in server side as python, java, javascript, php, and many more...
                <li>science: </li> This is an interesting part, we can see many simulations on phisics, Telecomunicatios, mathematics, the programming languages that are used in this fields 
                as in the others are almost any language, but usually we can see python, matlab, R, C, C++, and many more...
                <li>Mobile aplications</li> It is a very common topic too in programming, as web is so common we interact everyday with this technologies, common language programming for this topic 
                are Java and Kotlin for android, and swift for IOS, every day more options arise as javascript or python 
                <li>Many more...</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>To understand Programming we need to know some basics:</h4>
            <h4>Data types</h4> There are many data types and we need to know wich are the most common and when we can use it
            those Data types are variable depending of the programming language as well as how we write them (Boolean R:TRUE,FALSE python: True, False, javascript: true, false).
            <ul>
                <li><h6>String: </h6></li> Usually in quotes like: "Hello"
                <li><h6>Integer(Int): </h6></li> Integer number as 1 or 23
                <li><h6>Float: </h6></li> Integer number as 1.5 or 23.56
                <li><h6>Character: </h6></li> "D"
                <li><h6>Boolean or Logic: </h6></li> 1,0 or True, False
                <li><h6>Null: </h6></li> Not data: NA or if is not a number: NAN
                <li><h6>Imaginary: </h6></li> 1+ i3
            </ul>
            <h4>Data arrays</h4> we can create data arrays as we saw in linear algebra like:
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Vector: </h6></li> [1,2,3,4] or ["Hello", "this", "is", "a", "vector"] 1 x n
                <li><h6>Matrix: </h6></li> [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] [["hello","this","is"],["a","matrix","now"]] m x n
                <li><h6>Tensor: </h6></li> [[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],[[7,8,9],[4,5,6]],[[7,8,9],[4,5,6]]] .. n x m x h x ...
                <li><h6>Dictionary: </h6></li> {"brand": "Ford","model": "Mustang","year": 1964}
            </ul>
            <h6>Variables and Constants</h6> We can save this data in a memory and access to that memory using the variables and constants, those are nambes that 
            we give tu that data to use it again in the code, if the data variates is a variable if not is a constant.
            <h4>Operations: </h4> With those variables we can operate data, the operations could be:
            <h6>Logical Operations</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>less than (<)</li>
                <li>more than (>)</li>
                <li>more or equal (<=) and less or equal >=</li>
                <li>comparation (==) or (===)</li>
                <li>diferent (!=)</li>
                <li>not (!)</li>
                <li>or (|)</li>
                <li>and (&)</li>
            </ul>               
            <h6>arithmetic operations</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>*</li>
                <li>+</li>
                <li>/</li>
                <li>-</li>
                <li>%% (module)</li>
            </ul>               
            <h4>Those operations can be used in</h4>
            <h6>conditionals if:</h6>
            <pre class="code-box" style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><code class="language-javascript">
if(any condition){
    do this;
}else if(other condition){
    do this;
}else{ 
    do this;
}
            </code></pre>
            <h6>for loop:</h6>
            <pre class="code-box" style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><code class="language-javascript">
for(i=0; i=6; i++){
    Do this action till i=6;
}
//Or you can use it with arrays like
a=[1,2,3,6,7,9,25]
for(i in a){
    do this action till i go trough all a vector
}
            </code></pre>
            <h6>Functions</h6> Usually when you are programming parts of code are used many times, so you can use functions to just call that block of code:
            <pre class="code-box" style="height:auto; margin-bottom: 30px;"><code class="language-javascript">
function name_Function(usesThisVariable1,usesThisVariable2){
    Do any thing with variables
    return The result if any
}
            </code></pre>

            <h1>UML diagrams</h1>
            <h4>What are UML diagrams?</h4>
            The UML is a standard modeling language, are digrams to model projects usually used in software but it coul be used in any project, the UML diagrams are 
            so important to avoid everyone to undertsand a project removing ambiguity because is an Universal language.
            if you have doubts, you can consult the page: <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/">UML</a>
            <h4>The most used UML are: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Class diagram</li>
                <li>Sequence diagram</li>
                <li>Use case diagram</li>
                <li>Flow diagram</li>
            </ul>
            But there are many more
            <h4>Class diagram: </h4>
            The most common UML diagram is the Class Diagram, used in architectures where we can abstract the main characteristics of each 
            component is such a import start in software develope, because help us with a good reference to start and a really good practice
            this diagram is compose by:
            <h6>Classes: </h6> The classes are the components of the architecture, a class is the object that describes a grup of objects with same structure and behavior.
            We can see a class as a Block divide in three parts:
            <ul>
                <li>The first division (On the Top) is the title, the name of the class starting with a capital letter</li>
                example: A class could be: Car
                <li>The second division (in the middle) are the artibutes of the class (what artibutes this class have)</li>
                example: For the car we could have: model, color, country, owner... 
                <li>The last division are the methods, this are actions we can do with the atributes for our specific problem</li>
                example: For the Car the atributes could be register_car, set_car_as_sell()
            </ul>            
            <h6>Relations/Conector</h6>
            The class interact with other classes with relations like:
            <ul>
                <li>Asosiation in two directions:</li>
                Is a relation between two classes and could be represntented as a line between like: User ans Car
                We can represent the number of objects in the relation like 1 (if is one to one), M..N (if is M to N)
                <li>Asosiation in one direction:</li>
                This is represented as an arrow is a dependence relation like:  Car -> Wheels 
                <li>Agregation:</li>
                (A Class is compose by othe class is a hexagon) like: Company ♦- Departments
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                A class is a (other class); It's a arrow, but like a triangle, like:  Car -► Vehicle

            <h1>R Programming</h1>
            
            Note: If you want to keep going, you should know the basics concepts of programming, if you don´t know things like what is a variable, a programming language, funtions, etc. You can find info here: <a href="{% url 'course' 'Computer Science'%}"> Computer Science </a>
            <h4>What is R programming?</h4>
            R is the most used language for data analysis, brings many functions to process data, read, clean, search,
            calculate statistics, models, and more. 
            <h4>How to user R porgramming?</h4>
            First you need and R interpreter so you can download R language in any version (the latest version have more features, but may not be stable, try o choose a stable version)
            Then (is not necessary, but is better) you need a development environment, where you can see better your variables, results, etc.
            the most used is R studio, is opern source, so you can download and install it for free 
            <h4>Understand the Data:</h4>
            <h6>Datasets</h6>
            Once you have R studio installed you can start understandig the data, the data is usually shared trough a specific format so you can read it and organized by columns and rows as a table,
            where each column is a field and each table is an instance this grupos of data are called datasets, 
            there are many types of formar to share data, the most common are:
            <ul>
                <li>Comma Separated Values (CSV)</li>
                <li>Excel files (XLS)</li>
                <li>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</li>
                <li>Structured Query Language (SQL)</li>
                <li>tab-separated values (TSV)</li>
            </ul> 
            <h4>work with data R: </h4>
            <pre class="code-box" style="height:auto; margin-bottom: 30px;"><code class="language-r">
##########
#Download the data
##########
#you can use the downloader librery (a library contains functions made by others to make it easy)
#with downloader you can download the dataset from a url link
#for example:
install.packages("downloader") #to install the library
library(downloader) #load the library
#url of the dataset:
url <- "https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:UPValenciaX+DSC201x+3T2018+type@asset+block@tic-tac-toe.data.txt" 
#name to save the data set:
filename <- "tic-tac-toe.data.txt"
#download the dataset and save with name filename
download(url, destfile=filename)
#also you can download the dataset by hand and put the data set on the same folder of your project to read it
##########
#Read the data
##########
#you can also define the sepration of the data in the function as for example: ,sep=" "
#read.csv by default reads header and separated by comma
ticData <- read.csv(filename,header = FALSE) # read the data and saves it in the variable ticData
##########
#View the data
##########
#you can see your data with:
View(ticData)
#just the first files with
head(ticData)
#this data is saved in a data frame, but this data doesn't have a columns names
#this is not for all datasets, some data sets have the names, so you can read them as header = TRUE 
##########
#Name the columns (if no header)
##########
#create the name array of names: in c an array is <-c("the", "values")
columnNames<-c("topl", "topm", "topr", "midl", "midm", "midr", "botl", "botm", "botr", "class")
colnames(ticData)<-columnNames #Asign the column names to dataframe
head(ticData)#see the new data frame
names(ticData)#see the column names
##########
#Analyze the data
##########
#to select columns you can:
top1Data <- ticData$topl
#or 
subsetTicData <- ticData["topl", "topm", "topr"]
#you can see info of the data frame as:
summary(ticData)
#or most specific (if data is numeric) like:
BMI <- 	data.frame(
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight = c(81,93, 78),
   Age = c(42,38,26)
)
#all:
summary(BMI)
#specific:
#mean of height
mean(BMI$height)
#min value of height
min(BMI$height)
#median of height
median(BMI$height)
##########
#Plot
##########
#you can also plot as:
#create a facotr
factor<-factor(ticData$V1)
#A factor is like a vecotr that just take 1 time each value
#ej: if you have a, b, a, a, c, it will return a, b, c and saves how many times each value repeats
factor
#bar
plot(factor)
#pie
pie(plot(factor))
#histogram:
hist(plot(factor))
#For a scatter plot:
#data:
x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
y=c(0.9,2.3,2.8,4.5,5.4,5.6,7.1,8.4,8.7,9.9)

            <h4>Why python?</h4>
            As we've said before python is a multipurpose language is widely used in many fields, this is important because we can see many libraries and documentation for everyething, in data science, we have libraries made by 
            big companies like google, facebook, etc. and many implementations in products used everyday. 
            <h4>How to use python for data science?</h4>
            We will be using the same concept of dataset that we saw in R programming, to read data, clean data and using algotihms we have meny libraries in python,
            the most common and used are:
            <ul>
                <li>Pandas (read data, clean, analyze, ...)</li>
                <li>Sklearn  (many algotihms, split data, ...)</li>
                <li>Matplotlib (data visualization, graphics)</li>
                <li>Numpy (numeric operations, matrix, vectors, ...)</li>
                <li>Tensorflow (tensor operations, neural networks, ...)</li>
                <li>many more</li>
            </ul>
            You can also use any develope environment, but we recomend the jupyter notebook, you can install it with <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads">anaconda</a>
            <h4>Understand the Data with pandas and matplotlib</h4>
            To start working with libraries in python you need to install those libraries first, you can do that using pip (python 2) or pip3 (python3)

            <h1>Artificial Inteligence</h1>

            <h4>What is Artifical Inteligence?</h4>
            The artificial Inteligence (AI) is a field of the data science is so hard ti define what artificial inteligence is, because is hard to define what inteligent is, but we can say That
            artificial inteligente is a system capable of imitating human behavior, it can be physical or cognitive
            <h4>Machine Learning vs Aritificial Inteligence: </h4> is so important befor start with machine leargning, to know what machine learning is, and what is the difference with artificial inteligence.
            We can define machine learning as the ability of a system to learn a behavior, or characteristics from data, then knowing this we e cannot confuse what is AI and what is machine learning,
            for example if you can program a can program a robotic arm and say that it is artificial intelligence, but not machine learning, because it acts like a human, but he has not learned anything.
            but for example if we train a model so that it learns to recognize patterns in images to, for example, detect a respiratory disease like pneumonie that is machine learning

            <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
            
            As we saw in the las chapter we started with definitions of machine learning, and artificial inteligence, so for this chapter
            you know what machine learning is, so we will know main the types of machine learning
            <h4>Types of learning: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>supervised learning:</li> 
                When the algotihm learn from tagged data to predict unknow data, here we have two families of algorithms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Regression: </li> when data is numeric
                    <li>Classification: </li> when data is chategorical
                </ul>
                <li>unsupervised learning:</li>
                When we don't have tagged data so we want the algorithm to tell us features of the data, usually algotihms used in clustering.
                <li>reinforcement learning:</li>
                When the algotihm learn from his past actions and a reward used in games, or problems with no big datasets to train 
            </ul>
            <h4>Examples of algotihms of machine learning: </h4>

            <h1>Telecomunicatios Theory</h1>

            <h4>What are telecomunications?</h4>
            Are a way to send and recive information at a long distance. 
            Historically looking for ways to communicate over long distances has been a human need, from cases such as smoke signals or screams to current communication methods using electromagnetic waves in radio communication frequencies, 
            or even in the infrared or visible spectrum for fiber optics.
            <h4>frequency spectrum: </h4>
            actually there are many sistems that use electromagenitic communications, like the mobile data, or radio, but we have just one air, so we need to define 
            how to divide the service, this division is made by frequency, each frequency have differents characteristics like attenuation or transmission capacity, to regulate this 
            each goverment has a entity that regulates this, but we have some standarizations, an example of the electromagnetic spectrum is:
            <img id="TuringMachine" src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/electromagnetic-spectrum-vector-diagram-different-260nw-158016716.jpg"  class="responsive">
            <h4>architecture of a radio comunication</h4>
            A radio comunication usually have the same process, from when we capture the data in the sender to when we recive the data, the architecture is something like:
            <ol>
                <li>Transducer:</li>
                Get info from phisical like a sound to electric, for example a microphone
                <li>Modulator in tensmision: </li>
                We need to madulate the information so we can transmit it to avoid the noise, interference, etc.
                <li>Transmition antenna: </li>
                Element that conver the electrical information to electromagenitic waves
                <li>Channe: </li>
                The air
                <li>Reception antenna: </li>
                Element that conver the electromagenitic waves to electrical information
                <li>Demodulatior</li>
                <li>Transducer in Reception: </li> to display the data as it was before.
            </ol>
            There are more parts in a communication like filters, redundancy systems, and more, but those are the main in a radiocomunication.
            <h4>Actual communications architecture:</h4>
            The actual model to tranmit data used in internet is the TCP/IP

            <h1>Information Theory</h1>
            <h4>What is the information theory?</h4>
            In communications we have a system of layers that are part of the actual communications protocol used for example in internet, the chapter we saw Before
            was the fisical layer, but protocols as internet uses many others protocols, for example this page uses http, so  lot of information can be lost in the process
            to prevent this from happening, information theories are used.
            <h4>When information theory starts?</h4>
            The information theory startis in 1948 with the publication of claude sahnnon: <a href="https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2383162_7/component/file_2456978/content">A mathematical theory of communication</a></h6>
            The information theory of shannon gives a new workd for communications giving some rules and techniques to send information, with a better rate of success bits in reception, and even in some casesto reconstruc the data
            an example of a therorem of shannon is the:

            <h4> what are digital communications?</h4>
            The digital communications are comunications that uses 1 and 0 to send data on a electromagnetic wave of high frequency, there are many digital modulations 
            each modulation uses different techniques to variate amplitude, frequency, phase, or combinations, examples of digital modulations are
            <ul>
                <li>QAM</li>
